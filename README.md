## Future work and known issues
1. need a way to automatically source the keyword file in the robot script file
2. bug with the recorder loosing focus on tab when interacting with POM popup, to get around this start recording before selecting your POM
3. Add a way to run execute the dynamic POM, this will also be extremely helpful for debugging
4. look into adding API testing
